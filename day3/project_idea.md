# Steps Counter and Ranking

Component: 
1. Syftbox as the main platform
2. Export Apple Health Data 
3. Pre-process the data using Python Script
4. Generate a Syftbox app to load the data and preprocess it with Differential Privacy and Homomorphic Encryption (two use cases)


Key notes from today's hackathon:
1. DP can be applied on the app scripts, so it may be interesting to add DP/HE too
